The Iris Dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, contains the petal and sepal measurements of three different species of Iris \cite{fisher1936use}. The considered Irises are Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica. For each Iris, 50 samples are included and for each sample the dataset contains the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width in cm.
