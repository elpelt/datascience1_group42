In this section all used libraries are described briefly.

\subsubsection{pyclustering}
pyclustering is a data mining library, focusing on clustering algorithms written in C++ and Python by Andrei Novikov \cite{Novikov2019}. The library contains a wide range of clustering algorithms implemented in Python with an optional C++ core. If possible pyclustering falls back to its C++ implementations utilising its efficiency and runtime benefits.

\subsubsection{scikit learn}
scikit learn is a wide rangeing data analysis tool kit for python encompassing algorithms not only for clustering but for classification, regression and in general Data Science tools \cite{scikitlearn}.\\
Our implementations heavily depends on scikit learn implementations of distance measures, clustering algorithms, scoreing, data preparation like standardising and projecting results. 

\subsubsection{scikit learn extra}
scikit learn extra is an extension to scikit learn spanning algorithms that do not satisfy the inclusion criteria of scikit learn. This library is used for its implementation of K-Medoids that is fully compatible with all other scikit learn algorithms.

\subsubsection{numpy}
numpy is a fundamental library mostly used for its array structure implementing a C++/Fortran like way of saveing, organising and working with data while still being relatively easy to use. Being a dependency of every other package used in this project we naturally use numpy arrays to store and work with our datasets.

\subsubsection{matplotlib}
matplotlib is a popular python library for generating and plotting various types of graphs. For our project matplotlib is used for creating the graphs for index comparision.

\subsubsection{seaborn}
seaborn is a powerful data visualisation library build on top of pythons matplotlib. It simplyfies plotting by providing predefined templates. The \texttt{scatterplot} function is used for visualising the TSNE and PCA projections of the cluster results.

\subsubsection{streamlit}
streamlit is a easy-to-use library for building web apps. The webfrontend for our application is implemented using stremlit. Additionally the streamlit hosting service is used for serving the webapp.
