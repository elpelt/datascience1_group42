A variety of additional algorithms, distance metrics, parameter settings and cluster evaluation measures could be considered.

We did not found a best clustering algorithm neither a superior distance measure, which would give the best results on every dataset. This problem is widely known as the "No Free Lunch Theorem" \cite{nofreelunch}. As specific requierements may differ for diverse use cases multiple algorithms and parameters should be explored and compared according to individual needs.
