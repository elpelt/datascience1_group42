A distance measure is a function $d(x, y)$ that calculates a real value between two points in a space. If $d(x, y)$ satisfies the following three axioms the distance measure is classified as a \textit{metric}:
\begin{subequations} \label{metricaxioms}
    \begin{align}
        d(x, y) &= 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y &&\text{Identity of indiscernibles}\\
        d(x, y) &= d(y, x) &&\text{Symmetry}\\
        d(x, y) &\leq d(x, z) + d(z, y) &&\text{Triangle inequality}
%
\intertext{
    The triangle-inequality imposes the condition that a distance reflects the shortest path between two points. Thus it is not possible to achieve a distance improvement by traveling via an intermediate point $z$ \cite{MMDS}. \endgraf
    Moreover all axioms enforce non-negative distances as an additional condition.

        d(x, y) &\geq 0 &&\text{Non-Negativity} \label{metricnonnegative}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
