To determine the distance between two items the Manhattan distance, also referred to as taxicab distance, may be used. This distance measure assumes a n-dimensional vector space with a fixed cartesian coordinate system [wikipedia]. It is defined as following:
$$d(x,y)= ||x-y||_1 = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i|$$
where x and y are vectors
$$x = (x_1, x_2,..., x_n) \text{ and } y = (y_1, y_2,..., y_n)$$

Assuming a two dimensional space, the distance between two points is the shortest path between them with the restriction of only being able to move vertically and horizontally.
