The Homogeneity Score is an external clustering index to determine the quality of a calculated clustering in comparison to a preexisting grouping of items.
It is defined as following \cite{rosenberg2007v}:\\

\begin{align}
    h = 1 - \frac{H(C|K)}{H(C)}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    H(C|K) = - \sum_{c,k} \frac{n_{ck}}{N}\log\left(\frac{n_{ck}}{n_k}\right)
\end{align}

Here, C represents the true cluster labels of the datapoints and K represents the labels predicted by the clustering algorithm. $n_{ck}$ is the number of items in a cluster $k$, which are labeled $c$, i.e. share the same label. $n_k$ stands for the total number of labels present in cluster $k$.
When each cluster $k$ contains only items with the same label, the Homogeneity Score equals one.
