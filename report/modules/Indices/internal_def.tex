In addition to external cluster valdiation indices, there are also internal indices. These indices are based on internal criteria, defined as the evaluation of the result in terms of an information inherent in the data alone. This is needed for datasets where no predefined classification is given, such as the diabetes dataset. Compared to external indices, internal indices are known to be more accurate in determining group in a given clustering structure, but show poorer time complexity. \cite{int_ext}
