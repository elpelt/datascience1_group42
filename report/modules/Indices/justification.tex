Without random seeding, all cluster algorithm are invariant in the cluster naming and order due to randomized initialisation. Thus, all indices require that a permutation of the class or cluster label values does not change the score value in any way because the cluster remains the same. All four external indices have this property.\\
Another reason is that they belong to the scikit-learn library \cite{scikitlearn}, which makes it easy to include all four indices.
