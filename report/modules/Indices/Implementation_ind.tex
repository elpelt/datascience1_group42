All indices are implemented as a class function for the class Indices(). The code is part of the scikit-library (\cite{scikitlearn}) and expects two inputs for external cluster validation methods and just one input for internal methods. The input contains two arrays, namely the computed cluster labels and the expected cluster labels from the original data or only the second mentioned for internal methods. As output, a numerical value, usually between 0 and 1, is computed, depending on the selected cluster validation index.
