All indices are implemented as a class function for the class Indices(). The code is part of the scikit-library \cite{scikitlearn} and expects two inputs for external cluster validation methods and three input for the internal cluster validation method. The input contains two arrays, namely the computed cluster labels and the expected cluster labels from the original data. For the internal index, the input is expected to be the calculated labels, the original data points, and a metric to calculate the distances (default = selected metric for cluster calculation). As output, a numerical value between 0 and 1 is calculated for Homogeneity Score, Completeness Score, and \acrfull{ami}. For the \acrfull{ari} and the internal index Silhouette Score a value between -1 and 1 is calculated.\\
The user can add all scores to a comparison using a data structure called SessionState. All added calculations are visualized in the form of an interactive histogram created with Altair.
