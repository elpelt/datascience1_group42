Multiple libraries are used for their implementation of cluster algorithms and other functionality needed for working with results and visualising them. Below follows a brief description of all used libraries.

\subsection[pyclustering]{pyclustering v0.10.1.2}

pyclustering is a data mining library, focusing on clustering algorithms written in C++ and Python by Andrei Novikov \cite{Novikov2019}. The library contains a wide range of clustering algorithms implemented in Python with an optional C++ core. If possible pyclustering falls back to its C++ implementations utilising its efficiency and runtime benefits.\\
We use pyclusterings implementation of K-Means and K-Medians.

\subsection[scikit learn]{scikit learn v0.23.2}
scikit learn is a wide rangeing data analysis tool kit for python encompassing algorithms not only for clustering but for classification, regression and more \cite{scikitlearn}.\\
The library is used for its implementations of DBSCAN, One-Hot-Encoding, StandardScaler, t-SNE and PCA.

\subsection[scikit learn extra]{scikit learn extra v0.2.0}
scikit learn extra is an extension to scikit learn spanning algorithms that do not satisfy the inclusion criteria of scikit learn \cite{scikit-learn-extra}. This library is used for its implementation of K-Medoids that is fully compatible with all other scikit learn algorithms .

\subsection[numpy]{numpy v1.19.2}
numpy is a fundamental library mostly used for its array structure implementing a C++/Fortran like way of saveing and organising data while still being relatively easy to use \cite{numpy}. Being a dependency of every other package used in this project we use numpy arrays to store and work with our datasets.

\subsection[seaborn]{seaborn v0.11.0}
seaborn is a powerful data visualisation library build on top of pythons matplotlib \cite{Hunter:2007}. seaborn simplyfies plotting with predefined templates \cite{seaborn}. We use seaborns \texttt{scatterplot} template for visualising the t-SNE and PCA projections of the cluster results as well as generating the plots for clustering evaluation. 

\subsection[streamlit]{streamlit v0.82.0}
streamlit is an easy-to-use library for building simple web apps \cite{streamlit}. Our webfrontend is implemented in streamlit and is also hosted on their free sharing service .\\
